# TFG - Analysis of Early School Leaving in Catalonia

This Final Degree Project focuses on early school leaving in Catalonia, a problem
that has been decreasing in recent years but still falls short of achieving the European
Union (EU) target of 9%, set for 2030.

Despite efforts to reduce early school leaving, Catalonia still has a higher dropout
rate than the European average. This situation has significant implications for
the future of young people, as early school leaving is closely linked to lower social
and labor integration, as well as the perpetuation of inequalities. Achieving the
UEâ€™s 9% target is therefore essential to ensure that all young people have the same
opportunities to realize their potential and contribute meaningfully to society.

The results and conclusions of this project show that, despite the efforts made, there
is still a lack of broad access to detailed data on socioeconomic indicators for the
16 to 24 year old population. This lack of data hinders the work of independent
entities in analyzing in depth the factors influencing early school leaving. Therefore,
greater effort is needed from public administrations to make this data accessible,
fostering collaboration with independent entities that can provide new perspectives
and solutions to reduce this problem.
